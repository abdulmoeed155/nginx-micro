# nginx-micro

> **Ultra-minimal, statically-linked, multi-architecture NGINX Docker images.**

A blazing-fast, container-native NGINX image—just **hundreds of kilobytes**—with no shell, no package manager, and no attack surface beyond static serving and FastCGI.
**Purpose-built** for modern container stacks, edge deployments, and anyone who wants a rock-solid, tiny HTTP server.

## ⚡️ Why nginx-micro?

* **FROM scratch**: No shell, no package manager, no interpreter. Zero bloat.
* **Attack surface**: *Minimized.* Only HTTP and FastCGI (for PHP) are supported by default.
* **Security**: GPG-verified source, statically linked, no extraneous libraries.
* **Multi-arch**: Works on virtually any Linux system—cloud, Pi, mainframe, or edge.
* **Logs to stdout/stderr**: Perfect for Docker/Kubernetes observability.
* **Plug-and-play config**: Use the included config, or mount your own.
* **Built for insecure HTTP**: Use behind any SSL-terminating reverse proxy (Caddy, Traefik, HAProxy, nginx, Cloudflare, etc.).
* **SSL/TLS and gzip**: Optional tags (`-ssl`, `-gzip`, and `-upx` variants) for more features.

---

## 🛡️ Intended Use

* **NOT for direct SSL/public internet use by default!**

  * The `-ssl` tags add built-in HTTPS, but it’s still recommended to use a reverse proxy for cert management.
* *Ideal for:*

  * Static sites and health checks
  * PHP apps via FastCGI (`php-fpm`)
  * Serving assets in microservices
  * Demo, staging, CI pipelines
  * Ultra-lightweight edge deployments

---

## 🏁 Quick Start

### **Serve static files from your current directory:**

```sh
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 \
  -v $(pwd):/www \
  tigersmile/nginx-micro
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

---

### **Mount your own `nginx.conf` for full control:**

```sh
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 \
  -v $(pwd)/nginx.conf:/conf/nginx.conf:ro \
  -v $(pwd)/site:/www \
  tigersmile/nginx-micro
```

---

### **Use with PHP-FPM (e.g., WordPress/Drupal):**

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3"
services:
  nginx:
    image: tigersmile/nginx-micro
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./conf:/conf
      - ./www:/www
    depends_on:
      - php-fpm
    networks: [ web ]
  php-fpm:
    image: php:fpm
    volumes:
      - ./www:/www
    networks: [ web ]
networks:
  web:
```

---

## 📝 Default nginx.conf

```nginx
user  nginx;
worker_processes  1;
error_log  /dev/stdout warn;
pid        /nginx.pid;

events { worker_connections  1024; }

http {
    include       mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;
    access_log    /dev/stdout;

    sendfile      on;
    keepalive_timeout  65;

    server {
        listen       80 default_server;
        server_name  _;

        root   /www;
        index  index.html index.php;

        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }

        # For PHP-FPM
        location ~ \.php$ {
            fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
            fastcgi_param HTTP_PROXY "";
            fastcgi_pass   php-fpm:9000;
            fastcgi_index  index.php;
            include        fastcgi_params;
        }
    }
}
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

* **Runs as non-root (`nginx`, uid 101) by default.**

  * Enforced by `USER 101:101` in the Dockerfile and `/etc/passwd`.
  * No privileged capabilities.
  * Cannot bind to ports below 1024 unless run as root.
* No shell or package manager—cannot be “container escaped” by shell exploits.
* No writable filesystem, no interpreters.

> **Note:**
> If you need to bind to privileged ports (like 80/443) on a host, you may override the user with `--user root` or by building your own image, but this is not recommended for security reasons.

---

## 🏗️ Building Yourself

Requires Docker with Buildx and QEMU (for multi-arch):

```sh
docker buildx bake
```

*(Uses included `docker-bake.hcl` for all architectures and tags.)*
